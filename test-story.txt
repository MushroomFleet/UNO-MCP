As Sarah walked into the garden, she noticed the old statue in the corner. It was covered in moss and vines, almost hidden from view. She felt drawn to it somehow.

Tom had told her about this place, but he never mentioned the statue. She wondered why. It seemed important, like it held some secret.

She walked closer, her heart beating faster with each step. The air was still and quiet around her. Suddenly, she heard a rustling sound behind her. She turned quickly, but saw nothing.

Sarah reached out to touch the statue's cold surface. As her fingers made contact, she felt a strange sensation, like electricity running through her body. The statue's eyes seemed to follow her, though she knew that was impossible.

She stepped back, unsure what to do next. The garden had seemed peaceful at first, but now it felt different. Something had changed. Sarah knew she had to make a decision: leave now or uncover the truth about this strange statue and why Tom had kept it a secret from her.
